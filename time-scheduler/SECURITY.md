# Security Guidelines

## Authentication & Password Security

### ✅ **What We Do (Secure Practices):**

1. **No Password Storage in Client State**
   - Passwords are NEVER stored in Jotai atoms
   - Passwords are NEVER stored in localStorage
   - Passwords are only used temporarily during authentication

2. **Secure Authentication Flow**
   ```typescript
   // ✅ CORRECT: Pass credentials to API, store only user data
   const login = async (credentials) => {
     const response = await api.post('/auth/login', credentials);
     setUser(response.user); // Only store user data
   };
   ```

3. **User Data Only**
   - Store: `{ id, email, name, role, avatar }`
   - Never store: `{ password, token, secret }`

### ❌ **What We Don't Do (Security Anti-patterns):**

1. **Never Store Passwords**
   ```typescript
   // ❌ WRONG: Don't store passwords in state
   const passwordAtom = atom('userPassword'); // NEVER DO THIS
   ```

2. **Never Persist Credentials**
   ```typescript
   // ❌ WRONG: Don't save to localStorage
   localStorage.setItem('password', password); // NEVER DO THIS
   ```

3. **Never Log Credentials**
   ```typescript
   // ❌ WRONG: Don't log sensitive data
   console.log('Password:', password); // NEVER DO THIS
   ```

### 🔐 **Current Implementation:**

**Auth Store (`authStore.ts`):**
- ✅ Only stores user data after successful authentication
- ✅ Credentials are passed as parameters and immediately discarded
- ✅ Clear separation between auth input and stored state

**Login Flow:**
1. User enters credentials in form
2. Credentials sent to authentication function
3. Authentication function validates with API
4. Only user data is stored in state
5. Credentials are garbage collected

**Registration Flow:**
1. User enters registration data
2. Registration data sent to API
3. No credentials stored in client state
4. User redirected to login

### 🚀 **Future Security Enhancements:**

1. **JWT Tokens**
   - Store only JWT tokens (not passwords)
   - Implement token refresh
   - Automatic token expiration

2. **HTTPS Only**
   - All API calls over HTTPS
   - Secure cookie settings

3. **Input Validation**
   - Server-side validation
   - Rate limiting
   - SQL injection prevention

4. **Password Requirements**
   - Minimum length
   - Complexity requirements
   - Password strength validation

### 📝 **Best Practices:**

1. **Always validate on server-side**
2. **Use HTTPS in production**
3. **Implement proper error handling**
4. **Log security events (not credentials)**
5. **Regular security audits**
6. **Keep dependencies updated**
